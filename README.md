# Wazzle
[![CI](https://github.com/LucaSamore/OOP21-wazzle/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/LucaSamore/OOP21-wazzle/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

The purpose of this project is to be able to offer the user the opportunity to play some reinterpretations of famous video games.

# Current Status
 The initial release includes only two games, others may be developed in the future.
 By opening the game, you can access two different games.

# How do i play?
## Main Game
The aim of the game is to search for as many words as possible inside the waffle. The word will turn green if it is correct and red if it is wrong. During the game it is possible to take advantage of three different bonuses such as time increase, score increase and word suggestion.

## Mini Game
The object of the game is to guess the hidden word in six attempts. Start by typing any five letter word in the first row using your keyboard or screen, if the letter is correctly guessed and in the right place it will be marked green, if the letter is in the word but in the wrong place it will be marked yellow, if the letter is not in the word it will not be colored with any color.
